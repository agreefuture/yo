> the yo programming language

<br>

Yo is an interpreted programming language with a rust-inspired syntax. This repo includes a lexer, parser, compiler and interpreter, as well as a standard library that defines basic types like `String` or `Array`.

## Example

```rust
use "io";
use "std/string";

fn main(): int {
    io::print("hello world");
}
```
