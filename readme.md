> the yo programming language

<br>

Yo is an interpreted, statically typed programming language with a rust-inspired syntax. This repo includes a lexer, parser, compiler and interpreter, as well as a small standard library.

## Example

```rust
use "io";
use "std/string";

fn main(): int {
    io::print("hello world");
}
```
