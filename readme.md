> the yo programming language

<br>

Yo is an interpreted, statically typed programming language with a rust-inspired syntax. This repo includes a parser, compiler and interpreter, as well as a small standard library.

## Example

```rust
use "runtime";
use "io";

fn main(): int {
    io::print("Hello World");
}
```
