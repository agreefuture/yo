# `io`

## `io::print(format, ...args)`
Pass a format string, followed by a variable number of arguments. If there are more format specifiers than arguments, `null` is printed instead

Formatting:
- `%s` to print the value of the object
- `%t` to print the type of the object
- `%p` to print the object, as represented in memory (idk, just print the memory address or whatever
