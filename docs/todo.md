- [ ] reference counting
- [ ] `self.foo += x;` assignments (currently kinda works as a side effect of implicit seld access, ie `foo += 1` if self has a foo attribute)
- [ ] chained property access
- [ ] chained method calls
- [ ] tests
- [x] bitwise operators (NOT, AND, OR, XOR)
- [x] bitshift operators
- [ ] implement bools
- [ ] add support for floating point numbers (custom instructions `addf`, `subf`, `mulf` `divf`, what about `mod`, `not`, etc?)
- [x] array literals (TODO improve)
- [ ] nested binops (`((1 << 4) << 7)`) (TODO check, this might already work)
- [x] binary number literals
- [x] `ret obj[0] & 1048575;`
- [ ] underscores in number literals
- [ ] implicitly import stdlib modules (ie import "std/string" if the code contains a string literal, same for numbers, arrays)
- [ ] test that the examples in the documentation actually work
- [x] auto-synthesize `dealloc` functions (only if not otherwise defined)
- [ ] throw an error when the stack grows into allocated heap space / vice versa
- [x] implement some sort of `fatalError` function to abort w/ an error message
- [x] `Array.get`: negative index to access elements from back
- [ ] ternary expressions (only for assignment at first)
- [ ] elvis operator (`a ?? b`)
- [ ] `else if`
- [x] add type checks when assigning the return value of a function?
- [ ] macros
- [ ] make `nil` a macro for `0`
- [x] `break` out of `for`/`while` loops
- [ ] ensure that all custom `dealloc` methods return `void`
- [ ] ensure that `void` returning functions don't return anything other than `void`
- [ ] disallow `void` variable declarations (and function parameters)? they're currently treated as ints (as in also getting allocated stack space)
- [ ] support casts in chained access `(5 as Foo).bar`
- [x] `Self` to refer to whatever the current type is
- [ ] short circuit evaluation
